## Reverted Splashes

- "Not as cool as Spock!" to "Cooler than Spock!"
- "Moderately attractive!" to "Sexy!"

## Reasoning

I did not readd splashes that:
 - reflected now outdated and incorrect information
 - referenced Notch's marriage to EZ (who he later divorced)

I did not revert splashes that were changed to:
 - reflect changes within the game itself
 - reflect changes in the game's popularity
 - correct errors
 - make jokes

"Happy birthday, Notch!" used to be shown on Notch's birthday (June 1). I would readd it if there was a way that I could force it to only be shown on that date, but I know of no such method.
